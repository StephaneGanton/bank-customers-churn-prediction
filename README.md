## Bank customer churn Prediction Model

In this project, we build a model which can predict whether a customer will exit from a Bank or not ( `churn rate at bank` ). 

- ML Algorithms : **ANN** (Artificial Neural Network) and **Logistic Regression**. Notebook for each algorithm can be found within the corresponding folder.
  
- **Dataset :** available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmalit/bank-customer-churn-prediction). We also provide it in the project's folder.
- Then we use different techniques to `handle imbalanced data`.
- These techniques are :**undersampling of the majority class**, **overersampling of the minority class**, **SMOTE**, **Ensemble with undersampling**
